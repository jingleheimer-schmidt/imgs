A note on performance:
While a lot of time was spent optimizing the script impact this mod has, it is still asking the game engine to do quite a lot, especially on maps with lots of trains creating trails. If you encounter any performance issues please make a post on the discussion page or message me on discord (and include a save file too if possible!) The mod is a work in progress and any feedback is greatly appreciated :)
